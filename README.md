# cipher.py README File

## Purpose

The purpose of this function is to encipher a function by leeting the user input a chosen pad and file message, or allows the user to generate a pad to encipher the message. The user can also decipher a message by inputting a file with a pad and message. 

## Imports 

### **random** 

Used random package to use random.randrange() to get randoms numbers from ASCII 65 to 90 to make a random pad.

### **time**

Time package is used to create a file name with the time of the file. Only way I could keep track of the files that were made. 

## Inputs
- **message**: The filepath to the message the user will like to use.
- **pad**: The filepath to the message the user would like to use.
> Both inputs go through a readFile() to read the file and store the text in a variable to be used in the functions. The file has to read before going through the encipher() and decipher() function or else the code will not work.

## Functions

### **ask()**

This function takes no inputs and asks the user if they want to encipher or decipher.

### **getChar(message)**

This function takes the message input as a paramenter to turn every character in the message into an item in a list.
> ex: "Hi" would become ["H", "i"]

### **readFile(filename)**

This function takes the filepath from the user input so the file can be read and returned to be stored in a variable.

### **writeMessage(text)**

This function writes the text stored into a variable into a file that is given a name of secret with whatever time the file is made.

### **writePad(pad)**

Like the writeMessage() function,this function writes the pad generated by the user into a file. There is a separate write function for the pad and the secret message because when there was only one function, both got written in the same file. 

### **generatePad(message)**

This function takes the length of the length of the message and creates a random rumber between 65 - 90 corresponding to the ASCII code for A-Z and puts it into an empty list that is then made into a string and printed into a file. 

### **decipher(message, pad)**

Turns the message and pad into a list of characters with getChar() function and then turns each item in the list into its corresponding ASCII number with ord(). It then goes through a for loop which checks if each element in message is between 65 - 90 or 97 - 122 so we can make sure only letters are shifted. The for loop also checks if the item in pad is between 65 - 90 or 97 - 122 to decide how to shift the pad. 

> *Note*: Since we are deciphering, we subtract the message and pad after they are shifted. 

### **encipher(message, pad)**

Turns the message and pad into a list of characters with getChar() function and then turns each item in the list into its corresponding ASCII number with ord(). It then goes through a for loop which checks if each element in message is between 65 - 90 or 97 - 122 so we can make sure only letters are shifted. The for loop also checks if the item in pad is between 65 - 90 or 97 - 122 to decide how to shift the pad. 

> *Note*: Since we are enciphering, we add the message and pad after they are shifted. 

> *Important Note About Shifting Pad*: to shift the pad, there needs to be a separate variable, x = 0, that increments by 1 when the message us shifted so characters that are not letters dont get shifted, such as a space or dash.
